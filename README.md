This project scrapes web pages, extracts relevant company information, and generates a **professional brochure** using a LLM model. It filters and structures extracted data to create concise and informative content

# Features
User just insert link to main page! The code will scrape through all the links in that web page and extract:

- Page titles

- Page URLs

- Main textual content

- Filters out irrelevant content with help of LLM

- Combines extracted data into a structured format

- Uses LLM to generate a professional brochure

- Ensures the generated brochure is well-structured, concise, and relevant

- **Coming Soon:** User-interface to easily interact rather than running through the cell boxes!

# How to use
Open file `webpagebrochure.ipynb` and run through the steps with instructions inside. **If you are using downloaded Llama 3.2 model, make sure it is turned on/activated in your computer.**

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: beautifulsoup4 ollama

You can experiment with other LLM models than using Ollama (e.g. GPT-4). For quick guide on how to load models using API key refer to **Step 4b** of my code in:
